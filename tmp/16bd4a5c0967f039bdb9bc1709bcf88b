Javascript has a initial role to work as a scripting language to web pages. It suffered improvements in its mechanism over the years, gathering extra responsabilities than only manage browsers functionalities. With Node.js, it was made possible to use Javascript to build servers, nonetheless, Javascript is flexible enough to allow certain type errors commited by programmers. Smaller developments are manageable to this situations but larger ones may bring more complex problems.

Typescript is directly linked to Javascript but it aims to ensure that the type of code used is correct.
